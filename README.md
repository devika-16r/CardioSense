# CardioSense

### 📌 Overview

**CardioSense** is a supervised machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data. Using **Logistic Regression**, the model analyzes clinical features to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. This project demonstrates how data-driven methods can support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.


### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
* **Dataset:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset


### 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Checked for missing values
   * Normalized and cleaned features

2. **Model Training:**

   * Applied Logistic Regression
   * Trained on labeled patient records

3. **Evaluation:**

   * Measured accuracy using confusion matrix and score metrics


### ✅ Results

* **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
* **Achieved Accuracy:** \~87%
* Evaluated using a confusion matrix for performance insights
